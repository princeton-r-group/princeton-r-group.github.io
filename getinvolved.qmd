**Give a lightning talk to the R Group!**

We are always looking for new speakers for the R Group! Lightning talks (15 min) are a great way to showcase how you're using R in your research, highlight a new R package, or demonstrate an interesting new tool.

If you are interested in speaking for the R Group or getting involved in organizing, please fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/zrhrCdzXrnqwpz3t9).
