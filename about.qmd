We launched in [Spring 2023](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/events.html#spring-2023) as an initiative between graduate students Kim Kreiss (SPIA) and Angela Li (SOC). Since then, we have been co-organized by DDSS Graduate Fellows of Social Data Science and DDSS staff members.

We primarily focus on **applied use cases of R in research**, with a target audience of grad students and scholars who use the programming language in their work.

We aim to pick topics that are **widely applicable** across research areas, such as reproducible research, package development, and data visualization. Our event attendees have included researchers from all over the university.

**We welcome R users of all levels to our events.** However, because we focus on research use cases, our events tend to assume some working knowledge of R. Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about an event.

Note that we do not currently provide introductory workshops in R as there are many resources around the university that provide excellent training (see below).

## Learning R?

For more resources at Princeton for getting started with R, please check out the [Exploring R page](https://exploringr.princeton.edu/).

> Thanks to the work of Sorat Tungkasiri (Digital Learning Lab), Alex Hollinghead (Digital Learning Lab), Oscar Torres-Reyna (Economics), and Carolina Roe-Raymond (Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering and Research Computing) for this excellent resource!

We recommend the workshops and individual consulting through [Data and Statistical Services](https://library.princeton.edu/services/data-and-statistical-services), based in Stokes Library.

Additionally, check out the [Getting Started in Data Analysis in R](https://libguides.princeton.edu/dss/R) library guide compiled by Economics Librarian Bobray Bordelon.

## Current and past co-organizers

The Princeton tigeRs co-organizers for 2024-2025 are DDSS Graduate Fellow Angela Li and DDSS Research Data Engineer Eric Manning. We also thank [DDSS staff members](https://ddss.princeton.edu/staff-and-scholars) Karyn Gerecitano and Jess Hollinger for their support with events.

Our past co-organizers have been:
