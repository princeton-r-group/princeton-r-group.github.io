We launched in Spring 2023 and since then, we have been co-organized by DDSS Graduate Fellows of Social Data Science and DDSS staff members. Learn more about our past events on our Events page!

We primarily focus on **applied use cases of R in research**, with a target audience of grad students and scholars who use the programming language in their work. Our event attendees have included researchers from all over the university - representing the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities divisions.

**We welcome R users of all levels to our events.** However, because we focus on research use cases, our events tend to assume some working knowledge of R. Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about an event.

Note that we do not currently provide introductory workshops in R as there are many resources around the university that provide excellent training (see below).

## Learning R?

For more resources at Princeton for getting started with R, please check out the [Exploring R page](https://exploringr.princeton.edu/) put together by Research Computing (Carolina Roe-Raymond).

We recommend the workshops and individual consulting through [Data and Statistical Services](https://library.princeton.edu/services/data-and-statistical-services), based in Stokes Library.

Additionally, check out the [Getting Started in Data Analysis in R](https://libguides.princeton.edu/dss/R) library guide compiled by Economics Librarian Bobray Bordelon.
