Are you a graduate student, postdoc, faculty member, or research specialist working in R? Are you interested in sharing your work, expanding your network, and learning how others are using R in their work?

The Princeton R Group ("Princeton tigeRs") hosts informal monthly lunch events where we hear from scholars about interesting applications of their work in R. Learn more about our upcoming talks on our [Events](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/events.html) page!

**Our first event of the semester will be on** **September 25, 2024 at 12:15pm**. Professor Brandon Stewart will be speaking. Location and RSVP link will be sent out shortly. [Join our listserv](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/getinvolved.html) to stay updated!
