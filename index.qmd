Are you a graduate student, postdoc, faculty member, or research specialist working in R? Are you interested in sharing your work, expanding your network, and learning how others are using R in their work?

The Princeton R Group ("Princeton tigeRs") hosts informal monthly lunch events where we hear from scholars about interesting applications of their work in R. Learn more about our upcoming talks on our [Events](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/events.html) page!

We are generously supported by the [Data Driven Social Science Initiative (DDSS)](https://ddss.princeton.edu/events-and-workshops).
