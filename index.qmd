Are you a graduate student, postdoc, faculty member, or research specialist working in R? Are you interested in sharing your work, expanding your network, and learning how others are using R in their work?

The Princeton R Group ("Princeton tigeRs") hosts informal monthly lunch events where we hear from scholars about interesting applications of their work in R. Learn more about our upcoming talks on our [Events](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/events.html) page and [join our listserv](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/getinvolved.html) to stay updated!

**Our next R Group meeting will be on** **Monday, February 17, 2025**. Dates and details for our spring events can be found on our [Events page](https://princeton-r-group.github.io/events.html).

We are generously supported by the [Data Driven Social Science Initiative (DDSS)](https://ddss.princeton.edu/events-and-workshops).
