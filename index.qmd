Are you a graduate student, postdoc, faculty member, or research specialist working in R? Are you interested in sharing your work, expanding your network, and learning how others are using R in their work?

The Princeton R Group ("Princeton tigeRs") hosts informal monthly lunch events where we hear from scholars about interesting applications of their work in R.

Our events are supported by the [Data Driven Social Science Initiative (DDSS)](https://ddss.princeton.edu/events-and-workshops).
