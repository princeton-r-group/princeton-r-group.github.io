    "text": "We launched in Spring 2023 as an initiative between graduate students Kim Kreiss (SPIA) and Angela Li (SOC). Since then, we have been co-organized by DDSS Graduate Fellows of Social Data Science and DDSS staff members.\nWe primarily focus on applied use cases of R in research, with a target audience of grad students and scholars who use the programming language in their work.\nWe aim to pick topics that are widely applicable across research areas, such as reproducible research, package development, and data visualization. Our event attendees have included researchers from all over the university.\nWe welcome R users of all levels to our events. However, because we focus on research use cases, our events tend to assume some working knowledge of R. Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about an event.\nNote that we do not currently provide introductory workshops in R as there are many resources around the university that provide excellent training (see below)."

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to obtain high quality embeddings for non-English languages, and it may be computationally expensive to do so. I present ALC embedding resources that are adaptable to scholars’ idiosyncratic settings and show how to integrate them in a regression-style framework.\nLink to demo\n\nUsing Exponential Random Graph Models for Inferential Network Analysis (Ben Rosche, SOC)\n\nThis talk introduces exponential random graph models (using the statnet and ergm R packages) for modeling network formation. I show how these models can help uncover the micro-level mechanisms that shape macro-level network structures.\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2024\n\nWorkshop: Advanced Geospatial I - Analysis with R (Kim Kreiss, SPIA) - Feburary 24, 2024\n\nLink to Kim’s workshop materials on Github\n\n\n\n\nFall 2023\n\nWorkshop: Using ChatGPT and R for Effective Research and Teaching (Angela Li, SOC) - September 28, 2023\nInvited Speakers Talk: Formatted Optical Character Recognition (Zachary Bleemer, ECON) - October 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvited Speakers Talk: Embedding Regression: Models for Context-Specific Description and Inference (Arthur Spirling, POL) - November 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning Talks - November 30, 2023\n\nQuantitative Sociological Semantics and Conceptual Ethics (Zac Lim, SOC)\nRunning 100 Imputations on HPC Clusters (Muhammet Emre Coskun, SPIA)\nCreating Effective Shiny Apps (Jamie Caldwell, HMEI)\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2023\n\nWorkshop: Introduction to R for Public Policy Applications (Kim Kreiss, SPIA) - February 10, 2023\nWorkshop: Creating Engaging Data Visualizations in R with ggplot2 (Angela Li, SOC) - February 24, 2023\nGraduate Lightning Talks - March 24, 2023\n\nReproducible Coding Workflows (Varun Satish, SOC)\nR for Humanitarian Data Collection (Noe Hinck, SPIA)\nDeveloping a Shiny App for the Princeton Gym (John Kearns, SPIA)\n\nInvited Speakers Talk: Regression Discontinuity Analysis (Rocío Titiunik, POL) - April 5, 2023"
