    "text": "We launched in Spring 2023. Since then, we have been co-organized by DDSS Graduate Fellows of Social Data Science and DDSS staff members.\nWe primarily focus on applied use cases of R in research, with a target audience of grad students and scholars who use the programming language in their work.\nWe aim to pick topics that are widely applicable across research areas, such as reproducible research, package development, and data visualization. Our event attendees have included researchers from all over the university.\nWe welcome R users of all levels to our events. However, because we focus on research use cases, our events tend to assume some working knowledge of R. Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about an event.\nNote that we do not currently provide introductory workshops in R as there are many resources around the university that provide excellent training (see below)."
